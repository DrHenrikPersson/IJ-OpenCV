IJ-OpenCV is a Java library that allows the communication of ImageJ/Fiji - a software for image analysis that is widely employed in life sciences - and OpenCV - a well-known computer vision library.

There are several benefits provided by the communication of ImageJ/Fiji and OpenCV. From the ImageJ/Fiji perspective, this tool is enhanced with several computer vision and machine learning algorithms, avoiding the re-implementation of methods and the connection with several external libraries. From the OpenCV point of view, this library is improved with a simple-to-use GUI and with the functionality to manage regions of interest.

IJ-OpenCV is free to use and licensed under the license GNU GPL 3.0.
