IJ-OpenCV is a Java library that allows the communication of ImageJ - a software for image analysis that is widely employed in life sciences - and OpenCV - a well-known computer vision library.

There are several benefits provided by the communication of ImageJ and OpenCV. From the ImageJ/Fiji perspective, this tool is enhanced with several computer vision and machine learning algorithms, avoiding the re-implementation of methods and the connection with several external libraries. From the OpenCV point of view, this library is improved with a simple-to-use GUI and with the functionality to manage regions of interest.

This new version of IJ-OpenCV has been built on top of SciJava Common using SciJava converters.

IJ-OpenCV is free to use and licensed under the license GNU GPL 3.0.

### Download and Installation
You can download and intall the IJ-OpenCV library using maven:
```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId></groupId>
    <artifactId></artifactId>
    <version></version>
  </dependency>
```



The ImageJ plugins that have been developed using this library can be downloaded using the [ImageJ Update site](http://sites.imagej.net/IJ-OpenCV/).

You can download several images to test the plugins at the following [link](https://github.com/joheras/IJ-OpenCV/blob/master/utils/images.zip).
In order to execute the FaceDetection plugin it is necessary to download the following [file](https://github.com/joheras/IJ-OpenCV/blob/master/utils/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml) and copy it to the plugins folder of ImageJ.

### System requirements
IJ-OpenCV requires that ImageJ/Fiji works with Java 8.

### Source files

### List of IJ-OpenCV plugins
The source code of the following plugins can be found in the examples folder.
