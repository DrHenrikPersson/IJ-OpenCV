{"name":"IJ-OpenCV","tagline":"Connecting ImageJ and OpenCV","body":"IJ-OpenCV is a Java library that allows the communication of ImageJ/Fiji - a software for image analysis that is widely employed in life sciences - and OpenCV - a well-known computer vision library.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits provided by the communication of ImageJ/Fiji and OpenCV. From the ImageJ/Fiji perspective, this tool is enhanced with several computer vision and machine learning algorithms, avoiding the re-implementation of methods and the connection with several external libraries. From the OpenCV point of view, this library is improved with a simple-to-use GUI and with the functionality to manage regions of interest.\r\n\r\nIJ-OpenCV is free to use and licensed under the license GNU GPL 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n### Videos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nJÃ³nathan Heras (joheras@gmail.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
